## What is this course? 
WRIT 300 is meant to serve as an introduction to both technical and professional writing. As you will learn, these are very different fields, but they have enough in common to have a common foundation. This course currently serves as the core requirement for the University of Mississippi's Minor in Professional Writing. Thus, the course assumes that students have no prior experience with professional or technical writing. 

This course follows a survey model and will expose students to a wide range of topics, issues, and skills. It is intended to help students decide which trajectory they are interested in following for the rest of the minor. However, students taking the course as an elective outside of the minor will also find it a useful primer in professional and technical writing. The course has a practical focus and is designed to be career skill-driven. 

## How is the course structured? 
WRIT 300 is offered both online and face-to-face. There are differences between the two formats, but they follow the same curriculum for the most part. 

The course is based on a set of learning outcomes: 
* Understand how various organizations and industries define professional and technical writing as well as how various disciplines define professional and technical writing studies.
* Discuss what kinds of roles and what types of activities professional and technical writers perform within various organizations and industries.
* Define core concepts of professional and technical writing, such as genre, context, audience, culture, usability, writing, information design, work tools, usability, technology, and new media, and discuss how these concepts relate to the work of professional and technical writing.
* Use and apply knowledge of the kinds of documents; rhetoric and design principles; and digital tools, research skills, and writing strategies that mark ethical, effective professional writing practice.
* Identify and analyze patterns in one’s own writing practice and in the writing and communication practices of organizations or communities in which one works.
* Use problem-solving methods from the fields of professional and technical writing studies and rhetorical studies to invent or redesign texts and communication tools and to manage individual and collaborative writing projects.
* Design and compose a writing portfolio that showcases the student’s professional and technical writing competencies and projects a distinct professional writing identity.

Each project and assignment generally follows a problem solving approach, hence the title of the primary text for the course, *Solving Problems in Technical Communication*. 

Students will work individually and collaboratively on technical and professional writing tasks and will encounter (and design) a wide range of documents. Because of the nature of the course as a survey, students won't become *experts,* but they will have exposure and cursory understanding of a wide range of topics and concepts in the fields of technical and professional writing. 

## Portfolio Focus
WRIT 300, as the introductory course for the Minor in Professional Writing, has a strong focus on portfolio building. In addition to its application in future MiPW courses, technical and professional writers can expect to build and maintain some kind of portfolio over the course of their careers. This course serves to introduce the basic concepts involved in the construction of a portfolio, including the different ways one can be applied inside and outside of the academy.
