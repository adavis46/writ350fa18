# mydoc\_1-4

This first section was designed to introduce you to some basic definitions of professional and technical writing. Because this is a foundations course, we will only skim the surface of professional and technical writing. However, WRIT 300 will prepare you to engage more deeply with the concepts you encounter in higher-level professional or technical writing courses.

## Key Takeaways

* Professional and technical writing are two distinct but related fields.
* Technical writing is usually very specialized and has a specific audience
* Professional writing often has a broader, less-technical audience
* Technical writing's priority should always be accuracy
* Professional writing's priorities should always be ethics and clarity 
* The technical or professional communicator should be prepared, organized, clear, and ethical.
