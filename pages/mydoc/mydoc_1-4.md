This first section was designed to introduce you to some basic definitions of professional and technical writing. Because this is a foundations course, we will only skim the surface of professional and technical writing. However, WRIT 300 will prepare you to engage more deeply with the concepts you encounter in higher-level professional or technical writing courses. 

## Key Takeaways
- Professional and technical writing are two distinct but related fields.
- Technical writing is usually very specialized and has a specific audience
- Professional writing often has a broader, less-technical audience
- Technical writing's priority should always be accuracy
- Professional writing's priorities should always be ethics and clarity 
- The technical or professional communicator should be prepared, organized, clear, and ethical.
