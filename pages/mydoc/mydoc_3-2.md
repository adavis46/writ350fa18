## About Executive Summaries
Generally, abstracts and executive summaries fulfill similar purposes. If you have done a lot of academic writing, you are familiar with abstracts for journal articles. You've probably used these abstracts to help determine the utility of the article for your research (thus saving you the time of reading the entire article if not necessary). Executive summaries serve the same purpose: in an organizational context, the Executive Summary gives the audience the essential information to help them decide if it is necessary to read the entire report. 

It makes sense to write the executive summary after you've written the rest of the report. Students (and some professionals) often conflate the executive summary with the introduction to the report. They are NOT the same: think of the Executive Summary as an separate document all together. If someone only had access to the Executive Summary, that person should be able to get as much of the message of the report as possible. Obviously, if someone only had the introductory paragraph, he or she would probably be missing a lot of important information. 

Finally, remember that the Executive Summary should really "catch" the audience. Use concrete, active language and focus on exemplifying the relevance of the report to the audience. In a way, the Executive Summary should sell the rest of the report. 

### What about Length?
There is no set length for executive summaries. Generally they should never be longer than one single spaced page. For a short report like the one you are writing for project #1, a single paragraph is sufficient. Aim for about a half a page single spaced.
