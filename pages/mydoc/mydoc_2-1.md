Visualizations are an essential component of most writing in professional or technical contexts. The use of graphics and the types of visualization varies significantly by task and audience. The main purpose of a visualization in any context is to clarify, supplement, or enhance the information surrounding it. Thus, in your review of a document, the graphic should *help* your understanding of the content. If the graphic confuses you, or any other member of the audience, it is ineffective in either design or placement. 

Here are some general guidelines for including graphics in any type of document: 

* Use graphics to supplement or clarify information provided within the body of your report.
* Make sure your graphics are appropriate to your audience, subject matter, and purpose.
* Discuss graphics in nearby text preceding the graphic. Don’t just insert a graphic in your report unexplained. Orient readers to the graphic; explain its basic meaning, easily done in introductory and follow-up sentences before and after your graphic.
* Intersperse graphics and text on the same page. Don’t put graphics on pages by themselves; ideally, no visual should take up more than one-third of any page in your report.
* Use figure numbers and titles for graphics. Additionally, include identifying detail within the graphics such as illustration labels, axis labels, keys, and so on.
* Make sure graphics fit within normal margins. Leave at least one blank line above and below graphics.
* Place graphics as near to the point in the text where they are relevant as is reasonable. However, if a graphic does not fit properly on one page, indicate that it appears on the next page and put it at the top of the next, continuing with regular text on the preceding page. Don’t leave half a page blank just to keep a graphic near the text it is associated with.
* Cite all images that you create from any source material. You should do this in your introductory sentences before the visual as well as include a citation, if relevant, at the bottom of the visual. See samples above.
* Cite any images you use created by another writer which you include in your report. While it is perfectly legal to borrow graphics—to trace, photocopy, scan, or extract subsets of data from them, you are obligated to accurately cite your sources for graphics just as you are for the words you borrow.

Visualizations can play important roles at various points of the document development process. For example, flow-charts and other visual representations of process can actually provide a visual outline to follow for text. If you are trying to understand something in order to better document it, creating a visualization first may be helpful. 

One way to break this down is based on audience:

### Internal Process Visualizations
Internal visualizations can be a part of your documentation process. Think of the mind maps or word clouds you probably used in introductory writing classes to brainstornm. The mind map never actually made it into your final paper, but it was an essential part of the process. Rough visualizations and sketches can be repurposed for external audiences, but remember the main rule above: they must claify, not obfuscate, your message.

### External Process Visualizations
Flow charts and other types of process visualizations are an essential part of many technical documents. If, for example, you are writing instructions for documentation about a piece of radio equipment at the radio station you're interning with, a visual representation of the controls layout and how the function would be more helpful than a textual description. Likewise, if you are working for a large business and you have been tasked with understanding the company's business processes, a flow chart or network activity graph is an essential part of your report: the best way to depict the internal structure of an organization is to visualize it.
