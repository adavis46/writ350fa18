Professional writing is writing for reward or as a profession, or it is any form of written communication produced in a workplace environment or context. Works produced with the professional writing style allow professionals \(e.g. employers, lawyers, businesspeople, etc.\) to make informed decisions. Professional writing involves the use of precise language to convey information in a way that is easily understood by its intended audience, and it may be directed to inform, persuade, instruct, stimulate debate, or encourage action. For example, in a business office, a memorandum \(abbrev. memo\) can be used to provide a solution to a problem, make a suggestion, or convey information.

A professional writer may be freelance, meaning he or she works on a self-employed basis, or fully employed in an occupation where a professional writing standard is a prerequisite, such as journalism, marketing, advertising, public relations, the military, or technical writing. While not necessarily the practitioner's primary profession, professional writing skills are essential in many other fields such as law, medicine, business, engineering, and social work.

Like technical writing, there are few jobs called "professional writer." Rather, professional writing proficiency is often a part of other jobs. What's the main difference between technical writing and professional writing? Well, you'll learn that in this course, but one way to think about it is that technical writing is often always tied to a technical process of some kind. The domain of technical writing is often much smaller, and its audience more specific. Professional writing often must appeal to a broader, more dynamic audience.

So, why does professional writing matter?

## Communication Represents You and Your Employer

You want to make a good first impression on your friends and family, instructors, and employer. They all want you to convey a positive image, as it reflects on them. In your career, you will represent your business or company in spoken and written form. Your professionalism and attention to detail will reflect positively on you and set you up for success. In both oral and written situations, you will benefit from having the ability to communicate clearly. These are skills you will use for the rest of your life. Positive improvements in these skills will have a positive impact on your relationships, your prospects for employment, and your ability to make a difference in the world.

## Communication Skills Are Desired by Business and Industry

Oral and written communication proficiencies are consistently ranked in the top ten desirable skills by employer surveys year after year. In fact, high-powered business executives sometimes hire consultants to coach them in sharpening their communication skills. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers,National Association of Colleges and Employers. \(2009\). Frequently asked questions. Retrieved from [http://www.naceweb.org/Press/Frequently\_Asked\_Questions.aspx?referal=](http://www.naceweb.org/Press/Frequently_Asked_Questions.aspx?referal=) the following are the top five personal qualities or skills potential employers seek:

* Communication skills \(verbal and written\)
* Strong work ethic
* Teamwork skills \(works well with others, group communication\)
* Initiative
* Analytical skills  

Knowing this, you can see that one way for you to be successful and increase your promotion potential is to increase your abilities to speak and write effectively.

In September 2004, the National Commission on Writing for America’s Families, Schools, and Colleges published a study on 120 human resource directors titled Writing: A Ticket to Work…Or a Ticket Out, A Survey of Business Leaders.National Commission on Writing for America’s Families, Schools, and Colleges. \(2004, September\). Writing: A Ticket to Work…Or a Ticket Out, A Survey of Business Leaders. Retrieved from [http://www.writingcommission.org/pr/writing\_for\_employ.html](http://www.writingcommission.org/pr/writing_for_employ.html) The study found that “writing is both a ‘marker’ of high-skill, high-wage, professional work and a ‘gatekeeper’ with clear equity implications,” said Bob Kerrey, president of New School University in New York and chair of the commission. “People unable to express themselves clearly in writing limit their opportunities for professional, salaried employment.”The College Board. \(2004, September\). Writing skills necessary for employment, says big business: Writing can be a ticket to professional jobs, says blue-ribbon group. Retrieved from [http://www.writingcommission.org/pr/writing\_for\_employ.html](http://www.writingcommission.org/pr/writing_for_employ.html)

On the other end of the spectrum, it is estimated that over forty million Americans are illiterate, or unable to functionally read or write. If you are reading this book, you may not be part of an at-risk group in need of basic skill development, but you still may need additional training and practice as you raise your skill level.

An individual with excellent communication skills is an asset to every organization. No matter what career you plan to pursue, learning to express yourself professionally in speech and in writing will help you get there.
